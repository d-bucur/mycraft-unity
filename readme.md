# Voxel prototype in Unity

![](https://github.com/d-bucur/demos/raw/master/mycraft1.gif)


## Description
My atttemp at recreating a basic version of an 'infinite' procedurally generated voxel world.

## Controls
- **Left click** to build
- **Right** click to destroy
- **WASD** to move
- **Space** to jump
- Hold **shift** for speed and jump boost

## Details
You can configure most of the details of the world inside the *WorldBuilder* object, like how big each sector is and how far they are rendered. The world is generated by overlapping a bunch of configurable perlin noise maps.

For each sector only the visible faces of cubes are generated (the ones facing empty blocks that you can walk in). New sectors are generated during multiple frames trying to maintain a 60 FPS target. This can be increased by reducing the size of a sector and reducing the time bugdet.
